# Versioning

A Behavior release has one version number, but it carries several independent versions. They
change for different reasons, and every one of them is reported, never implied
(`behavior.versions()`, `behavior engine-info`, `release-manifest.json`).

| Kind | Example | What it identifies | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Release / engine** | `0.10.2` | the implementation release: the engine crates and the command-line tool | `[workspace.package] version` in `Cargo.toml`, the single source |
| **Public Rust surface** | `behavior-engine` | the only supported programmatic API (feature 011) | `api/engine-surface.txt`, checked against `crates/behavior-engine/src/lib.rs` |
| **Wire IR** | `0.1` … `0.7` | the module document format (and, from 0.7, the read document); a new semantic form needs a new IR version | `crates/behavior-core/src/wire.rs` |
| **Records** | `0.4` … `0.6` | the decision record format | `crates/behavior-core/src/eval.rs` |
| **Read records** | `behavior.read_record.v1` | the evidence of a read (feature 010); never stored by a store | `crates/behavior-core/src/read.rs` |
| **Store documents** | `behavior.commit_bundle.v1`, … | persistence documents (genesis, versions, records, bundles, reports) | `crates/behavior-store/src/documents.rs` |
| **Migration IR** | `0.1` | the migration document format (feature 009); `schema/migration-ir-0.1.schema.json` | `crates/behavior-core/src/migration/wire.rs` |
| **Verifier** | `0.6.0` | the verification encoding; part of every attestation and cache key | `VERIFIER_VERSION` in `crates/behavior-verify/src/lib.rs` |

A module document, a record or a store document says which format version it is written in.
That is what a reader checks, not the release number.

## Release version policy (0.x)

While the release is below 1.0, the **minor** number marks anything a consumer must adapt to:

- **Minor bump** (`0.8.x` → `0.9.0`):
  - any change to behavior identities (item hashes, behavior versions);
  - a new wire IR, record or store document version, or a change to an existing one;
  - removing or changing a public API element: an item of `behavior-engine`
    (`api/engine-surface.txt`), a command or output of the CLI, or a document format;
  - a verifier change that can alter outcomes, together with a `VERIFIER_VERSION` bump.
- **Patch bump** (`0.8.0` → `0.8.1`):
  - additive public API;
  - fixes that change no identity, format or verification outcome;
  - documentation and skills.

After 1.0, the same rules apply with **major** in place of minor.

Release 0.10.2 is the first published release of Behavior Core as its own repository (feature
011). The tag `v0.10.1` exists but was never released: the release workflow fetched it without
its annotation and refused it, so under the tag rule (a tag is never moved) the fixed workflow
releases 0.10.2, with the same engine and no other change.

Release 0.10.1 is a patch release: the first release of Behavior Core as its own repository
(feature 011). It adds the public Rust surface `behavior-engine` (additive) and publishes the
command-line tool and the conformance fixtures as release assets. No identity, document format or
verification outcome changes: every conformance fixture, golden record, hash vector and engine
output is byte-identical to 0.10.0.

Release 0.10.0 was a minor bump for three reasons:

- **Wire IR 0.7:** a module's `reads` section (declared reads, a new behavior item kind) and the
  read document (an ad-hoc read). A module with declared reads has a new behavior version, never a
  new schema; a module without them keeps its bytes and identity.
- **A new document kind:** the read record `behavior.read_record.v1`, with its identity
  `read:sha256:…`.
- **`VERIFIER_VERSION` 0.6.0**, for the `evaluation_error` checks of declared reads.

Every existing module, decision record, store document, hash vector and attestation format keeps
its bytes.

Release 0.9.0 was a minor bump for three reasons:

- **Exact store-schema binding** replaces the touched-types comparison. A module that differs from
  the store only in an entity type its action does not touch used to evaluate and now gets
  `SCHEMA_MISMATCH`, and the old code `ENTITY_DECLARATION_MISMATCH` is no longer reported for it.
- **A new document kind:** the migration IR 0.1, plus optional fields that existing documents
  never carry: `Head.schema`, the record `kind` and `migration` fields, and
  `EvidencePolicy.migration`.
- **`VERIFIER_VERSION` 0.5.0**, for migration verification and the narrowing obligation.

Every existing module, record, genesis, store head (of a store that never migrated), evidence
policy and attestation format keeps its bytes.

## Compatibility promise

Release 0.11.0 is a minor bump: it introduces the versioned capability-boundary
formats `behavior.invocation.v1`, `behavior.capability_intent.v1`,
`behavior.snapshot.v1` and `behavior.invocation_record.v1`, along with the unified
invocation API and CLI. Wire IR, admission, verifier version and existing formats
are unchanged. Original evaluators remain frozen compatibility paths.

| Superseded capability format/path | Current form |
|---|---|
| Resolved action request (`eval`) | `behavior.invocation.v1` (`invoke`) |
| Legacy action intent (`targets`, `intent`) | `behavior.capability_intent.v1` (`invoke-intent`) |
| Legacy read intent (`read-intent`) | `behavior.capability_intent.v1` (`invoke-intent`) |
| Resolved read request (`read`) | `behavior.invocation.v1` (`invoke`) |

See [invocation](invocation.md) for the complete evidence and replay contract.

- Documents written by any release of a minor line (modules, records, stores, attestations) are
  read and replayed by every later release of the same line with identical results.
- A release that cannot read a document refuses it explicitly: the wire, record and store
  version gates report the unsupported version. It never produces different results
  silently.
- An existing document format never changes its bytes. New forms get a new version; documents
  without them keep their old version and bytes.

## Releases

A release is the annotated tag `v<version>` on a commit that passed `scripts/release-check.sh`,
together with the artifacts `scripts/release.sh` built into `dist/v<version>/`. Tags are never
moved; a fix is a new patch release.

## Bindings

Bindings and their packages are versioned by the ecosystem repository (behavior-ir). Each of its
releases names the exact Core Release it bundles, by version and commit, and a binding refuses
to run on any other core. The core never refers to a binding.
